# Caching System

**Overview**

This documentation outlines the process and planning for the development of a caching system that integrates Redis with Docker. The deployment will be facilitated through a DigitalOcean Droplet.



## System Components

The system comprises the following components:

### 1.Redis Integration:
- Redis, a powerful in-memory data store, will be integrated into the system for efficient caching.

### 2.Docker Deployment:
- The application will be containerized using Docker, providing a consistent and portable environment.

### 3.DigitalOcean Droplet:
- Deployment will be orchestrated on a DigitalOcean Droplet, ensuring scalability and reliability.



## Redis Management System

The primary objective is to create a Redis management system using Node.js. This system will provide an interface for interacting with Redis, allowing users to perform key operations.



## Development Environment

To set up the caching system, follow these steps:

### 1.Clone the Repository:

- Clone the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-caching-repo.git
```

### 2.Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

```bash
cd repository

pnpm install
```



## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the caching system's architecture, development environment setup, and details about the Redis management system. Follow the outlined steps to deploy and manage caching efficiently.
