# Future Features for Redis Management System

To enhance the **Redis Management System**, consider adding the following features. These improvements aim to provide greater control, efficiency, and usability, especially as the system grows in complexity.

## 1. Key Search and Filtering
   - Add the ability to search for or filter keys by pattern, e.g., keys that start with "user:" or "session:".
   - This feature simplifies key management when dealing with a large number of keys.

## 2. Key Grouping
   - Implement functionality to group keys by category or type, such as sessions, cache, or temporary data.
   - Grouping makes managing diverse key types easier and more organized.

## 3. Alert System
   - Add notifications for keys nearing expiration (TTL about to expire) or when Redis memory usage exceeds a specified threshold.
   - Alerts can be sent via email, Slack, or Line, providing real-time system status updates.

## 4. Backup and Restore
   - Include options to back up Redis data to a file or restore it from a backup.
   - Useful for protecting essential data in Redis and preventing data loss.

## 5. TTL (Time-to-Live) Management
   - Allow setting TTL for individual or grouped keys, and monitor keys that are about to expire.
   - This feature assists in managing temporary data, such as expiring sessions.

## 6. Usage Statistics
   - Add a statistics dashboard to display Redis usage metrics such as daily requests, cache hit/miss rate, memory usage, latency, and key count.
   - Analyzing these metrics provides insight into Redis usage patterns and highlights areas for optimization.

## 7. User Management System
   - Add user roles with defined access levels, such as Admin or Read-only.
   - Enhanced access control ensures that only authorized personnel can interact with sensitive Redis data.

## 8. Access Control and Permissions
   - Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) for individual users to define permissions for accessing or modifying Redis keys.
   - Restricting permissions minimizes the risk of accidental deletions or unauthorized modifications.

## 9. Audit Log
   - Log all key changes, including additions, deletions, modifications, and data access.
   - Audit logs are valuable for tracing issues or reviewing historical modifications.

## 10. Multi-cluster Support
   - Support multiple Redis clusters within a single interface, allowing management of multiple Redis instances.
   - Useful for environments that require Redis Clustering or load distribution across multiple servers.

Adding these features will enhance the Redis Management System's capabilities, improving efficiency, security, and usability for larger-scale applications.
